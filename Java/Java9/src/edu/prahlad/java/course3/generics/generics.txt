Generics
    1) Liskov Substitution Principle
    2) Strong Compile Time check
    3) Type Parameters
        E - Element
        K - Key
        N - Number
        T - Generic Type
        V - value
    4) Type Erasure: the process that occurs during compile time
                     to remove the explicit type information from a program
    5) bounded types: Make it possible to apply compile time-enforced restrictions
        on the kinds of type parameters that a generic may be used with
    6) generic interfaces: Interfaces that are declared with type parameters
    7) generics: A facility of generic programming added to Java to reduce bugs
    8) raw type: the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments
