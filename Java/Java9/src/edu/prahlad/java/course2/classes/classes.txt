Class: A blueprint for creating objects
Object: An instance of a class

Storage
    Heap  : Objects are stored
    Stack : Primitives & short-lived variables

OOPs
    Procedural Programming: variables, functions in functions > spaghetti Code
    Encapsulation: Bundle the data & methods that operate on the data in a single unit.
    Abstraction: Reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details
    Coupling: The level of dependency between classes
    MethodOverloading: Same method name, different method params, constructor can be overridden as well
                       Totally different params are preferred, don't overuse this
    Static Members
