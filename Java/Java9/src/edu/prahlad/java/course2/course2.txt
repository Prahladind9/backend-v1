0) Basics
1) Classes
    Class, Object
    Storage :   Heap, Stack
    Concepts:   Procedural Programming, Encapsulation, Abstraction
                Coupling, MethodOverloading, Static Members

2) Inheritance - IS-A Relation
    Polymorphism: Many-forms
        Constructors
        Access Modifiers
        Object: gives the below method
            getClass,
            equals; comparing objects with values stored in their fields
            hashCode; of the address of the object, stored in the memory
            toString; fully qualified class@hexadecimal of hashcode
            concurrency; notify, notifyAll, wait

        Method Overriding
        Up-casting  :   Casting an object to one of its "super" types
        Down-casting:   Casting an object to one of its "sub" types
                        Handle ClassCastException

        Comparing Objects
        abstract, final
        Deep Inheritance hierarchies are not recommended > max 3 levels
        Multiple Inheritance is not supported
