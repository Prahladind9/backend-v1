ObjectComposition
Class - Composition - state - operations

Inheritance
    > Helps to reuse our code
    > Method Overriding
    > Method Overloading

Interface is a contract
    > one class can have multiple interface implemented
    > default methods
Abstract - abstracting out some common logic
    > cannot be instantiated
    > only one class can be extended

Polymorphism

Collections > List, Set, Queue, Map
    Set > Unique Values are stored, no duplicates
    Hash
        > Unordered, Unsorted
        > uses hashcode() - HashSet

    Linked
        > insertion order is saved, unsorted
        > uses hashcode() - LinkedHashSet

    Tree
        > Sorted - natural order
        > implements NavigableSet/Map ...

    Vector-HashTable > Many are Synchronised methods - Thread Safe
    List.of or Map.of ... Immutable collection can be created

    Functional Programming - first class status to functions

        > stream - many intermediate, one terminal operations
        > filter, reduce, map - no mutations of state
        > pipeline, boxed
