Recursion is when a method calls itself again & again
until it reaches a specified stopping condition.
In general, the method mentioned above is called a recursive method
    a) Base Case
    b) Recursive Case

Direct vs Indirect Recursion
    Direct recursion occurs when a method calls itself
    Indirect recursion occurs when a method calls another method,
        eventually resulting in the original method being called again.
