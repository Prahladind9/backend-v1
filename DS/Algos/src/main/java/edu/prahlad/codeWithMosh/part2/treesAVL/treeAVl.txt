Tree Balance Evaluation
    BalanceTree     : height(left) - height(right) <= 1
    UnBalancedTree  : height(left) - height(right) > 1
    Worst Tree      : Left/Right Skewed ~ similar to LinkedList

BST
    Average : O(log n)
    Worst   : O(n)

Self-Balancing Trees
    AVL Trees (Adelson-Velsky and Landis)
    Red-black Trees
    B-Trees
    Splay Trees
    2-3 Trees

AVL Trees
    Using Rotations >> AVL Trees balance the tree & maintain
                    >> height(left) - height(right) <= 1
    Rotations
        Left (LL)
        Right (RR)
        Left-Right (LR)
        Right-Left (RL)
