Heap
    Binary Tree should be complete: left sub-array must be filled
    Heap Property: Node will be the max value of all the tree > called Max Heap

Uses
    Sorting (HeapSort)
    Graph algorithms (Shortest Path)
    Priority queues
    Finding the Kth smallest/largest value

Rearranging Tree after insert/remove
    Bubble up
    Bubble down

Array can be used to implement Heap
    left  = (parent*2) +1
    right = (parent*2) +2
    parent = (index-1)/2
