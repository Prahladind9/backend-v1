What Solution is best?
    Faster?
    Less memory-intensive?
    More readable?

The problem with Time
    Different machines will record different times
    The same machine will record different times!
    For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough?

If not time, then what?
    Rather than counting seconds, which are so variable ...
    Let's count the number if simple operations the computer has to perform!

BigO Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting
    It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm
    grows as the input grow

Space Complexity
    how much additional memory do we need to allocate in order
    to run the code in our algorithm?
