How do we search?

Linear Search
    Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is
    to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want

Binary Search
    Binary Search is a much faster form of search
    Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate
    half of the remaining elements at a time
    Only works on sorted arrays!

Naive String Search
    Count the number of times a smaller string appears in a longer string
        Loop  through longString & check pattern matched for shortString
        when match increment the counter
