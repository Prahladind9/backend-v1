     * 0) Visualize the question
     *     "abccabb" - 3
     *
     * 1) Verify the constraints
     *      a) Is the substring contiguous?
     *          Yes, look for a substring not a subsequence
     *              substring vs subsequence
     *      b) Does case sensitivity matter?
     *          No, assume all characters in the string are lowercase
     *
     * 2) Write out some test cases
     *      "abccabb"   3
     *      "cccccc"    1
     *      ""          0
     *      "abcbda"    4
     *
     * 3)
